# Wireshark-Packet-Analysis
- OVERVIEW
* This project demonstrates how to use Wireshark to capture, analyze, and export network traffic data.

- STEPS PERFORMED
* Installed Wireshark
* Started packet capture
* Generated work traffic
* Stopped capture
* Filtered packets by protocol
* Identified few protocols
* exported the capture after editing with tracewangler for secure data

- OUTPUT
* Captured File: 'CSITASK5.pcappng'
* Duration: ~1 minute
* Protocols Observed: DNS,ICMP,TCP

- CONCLUSION
This project shows how Wireshark can be used to monitor and analyze live network traffic.  
By filtering and studying packets, we gain insights into how different protocols interact to support communication over the internet.
